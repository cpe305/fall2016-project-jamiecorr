[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305/fall2016-project-jamiecorr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305/fall2016-project-jamiecorr)

##Purpose##
Card Casino is a desktop application for playing Blackjack and Poker.  This project was developed as an individual project for Professor Gudrun Socherâ€™s CPE 305 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Fall 2016.

##Functionality##
Users are able to choose which game they want to play, declare a betting amount, and play the chosen game.  After each game is finished, the amount won or lost will be added or subtracted from the user's bank. Their bank will stay with them throught their time in the casino. Users will have the option of playing the same game again, playing the other game, or leaving the casino.  The end goal of Card Casino is to provide entertainment to the user and either teach them how to play or allow them to improve their playing skills.
