  "body": "# Card Casino\r\nCard Casino is a desktop application for playing Blackjack and Poker.  Users are able to choose which game they want to play, declare a betting amount, and play the chosen game.  After each game is finished, the amount won or lost will be added or subtracted from the user's bank. Their bank will stay with them throughout their time in the casino. Users will have the option of playing the same game again, playing the other game, or leaving the casino.  The end goal of Card Casino is to provide entertainment to the user and either teach them how to play or help improve their playing skills.  \r\n\r\n![X](menu1-1.png)\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n* Starting Menu\r\n* Blackjack\r\n* Video Poker\r\n* Universal Bank\r\n* End Game buttons to return to menu\r\n\r\n### MVC Architechure Pattern  \r\n![](images/arch.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram\r\n![](images/classDiagram.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\nThe Singleton pattern was implemented in making the universal bank feature of the casino. The pattern ensures that there can only be one instance of this class and it is a shared resource among several classes.\r\n\r\nLooking back, using the Observer pattern to update the GUI by connecting to the console would have been more efficient.\r\n\r\n### Walk Through  \r\nFirst screen the user sees is the main menu of the casino.  \r\n![](images/menu.png)  \r\n\r\nWhen the \"Play Blackjack\" button is clicked, the Blackjack screen loads a new game.\r\n![](images/menu1-1.png)  \r\n\r\nStart by placing a bet and then click the \"Deal\" button.\r\n![](images/menu1-2.png)\r\n\r\nTwo cards are dealt to each player.  The player can only see one of the dealer's cards at this point.\r\n![](images/menu1-3.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Play Poker\" button is clicked, the Poker screen loads a new game.\r\nStart by selecting a bet level and then click the \"Deal\" button.\r\n![](images/menu2-1.png)  \r\n\r\nThe table column corresponding to your bet level will be highlighted in the pay table.\r\n![](images/menu2-2.png)\r\n\r\nTo remove unwanted cards from your hand, click the \"Discard\" button under that card.\r\nAfter clicking the \"Finish\" button, the discarded cards will be redealt and the hand will be evaluated.\r\n![](images/menu2-3.png)\r\n\r\nIf you win, the table row corresponding to your winning value will be highlighted in the pay table.  The amount in the intersection of the two highlighted purple rectangles will be added to your bank. \r\n![](images/menu2-4.png)\r\n\r\n### Key Learning\r\n* JavaFX!\r\n* Brainstorm architecture and design patterns before starting to write any code\r\n* Test early and frequently\r\n* Document code as it is written",
