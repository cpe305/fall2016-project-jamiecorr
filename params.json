  "body": "# Card Casino\r\nCard Casino is a desktop application for playing Blackjack and Poker.  Users are able to choose which game they want to play, declare a betting amount, and play the chosen game.  After each game is finished, the amount won or lost will be added or subtracted from the user's bank. Their bank will stay with them throughout their time in the casino. Users will have the option of playing the same game again, playing the other game, or leaving the casino.  The end goal of Card Casino is to provide entertainment to the user and either teach them how to play or help improve their playing skills.  \r\n\r\n![X](menu1-1.png)\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n* Starting Menu\r\n* Blackjack\r\n* Video Poker\r\n* Universal Bank\r\n* End Game buttons to return to menu\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\nThe Singleton pattern was implemented in making the universal bank feature of the casino. The pattern ensures that there can only be one instance of this class and it is a shared resource among several classes.\r\n\r\nLooking back, using the Observer pattern to update the GUI by connecting to the console would have been more efficient.\r\n\r\n### Walk Through  \r\n\r\n![jamie](images/menu1-3.png)\r\n\r\n### Key Learning\r\n* JavaFX!\r\n* Brainstorm architecture and design patterns before starting to write any code\r\n* Test early and frequently\r\n* Document code as it is written",
